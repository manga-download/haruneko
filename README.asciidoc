## Development

Make sure **git** and **NodeJS + NPM** are installed on your system.

### Installation

First start by cloning the repository from https://github.com/manga-download/haruneko.git
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/manga-download/haruneko.git"
```

Then change into the project directory and install the dependencies +
```bash
npm install
# If you are on Apple Silicon (arm64) and NW isn't starting, try:
# See: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/8157
xattr -cr ./node_modules/nw/nwjs/nwjs.app
```

### Run

HakuNeko consists of two parts, a web-application that needs to be hosted and an NW.js client running the web-application.

As a developer you probably want to launch the application and also want changes made to the source code reflecting in the running application.
This can be achieved by hosting the source code directly on http://localhost:3000
```bash
npm run serve:dev --workspace web
```
Then launch the NW.js application to load the hosted web-application
```bash
npm run launch:dev --workspace app/nw
```

The same procedure can be applied to run a production build of both parts, but these can not be modified while running.
Host the production web-application on http://localhost:5000
```bash
npm run serve:prod --workspace web
```
And then start the production NW.js application
```bash
npm run launch:prod --workspace app/nw
```

////
Use the console from the developer tools (F12) to investigate `HakuNeko` API, e.g.

```javascript
(async () => {
    const website = HakuNeko.PluginController.WebsitePlugins[0];
    console.log('Website:', website.Title);
    if(website.Entries.length === 0) {
        console.log('=>', 'Updating manga list (this may take some time ...)');
        await website.Update();
    } else {
        console.log('=>', 'Using manga list from local cache');
    }

    async function getPages(mangaIndex, chapterIndex) {

        const manga = website.Entries[mangaIndex]; // or with iterator: [...website][mangaIndex];
        console.log(' '.repeat(4), 'Manga:', manga.Title);
        if(manga.Entries.length === 0) {
            console.log(' '.repeat(4), '=>', 'Updating chapter list');
            await manga.Update();
        } else {
            console.log(' '.repeat(4), '=>', 'Use current chapter list');
        }
        
        const chapter = manga.Entries[chapterIndex]; // or with iterator: [...manga][chapterIndex];
        console.log(' '.repeat(8), 'Chapter:', chapter.Title);
        if(chapter.Entries.length === 0) {
            console.log(' '.repeat(8), '=>', 'Updating page list');
            await chapter.Update();
        } else {
            console.log(' '.repeat(8), '=>', 'Use current page list');
        }
        
        for(const page of chapter) {
            console.log(' '.repeat(12), 'Page:', page.SourceURL);
        }
    }

    await getPages(0, 0);
    await getPages(13, 7);
```

### Continuous Inspection

After making changes to the source code, it is recommend to validate the code style, check for code smells and perform a static code analysis.
```sh
npm run check
```

### Testing

To ensure the application behaves as expected, tests need to be added.
The popular `jest` framework is used as test runner and for mocking.
All tests are written side by side to their (logical) corresponding implementation directly in the source code directory.
Overall, there are two test categories.

#### Unit and Component Tests
Unit tests (file extension `⋆.test.ts`) are very lightweight within a limited scope (e.g. single method of a class).
Component tests (file extension `⋆.spec.ts`) can be more complex and test relations and coherences within a module (e.g. a composed UI control).
To start these tests, simply run
```sh
npm run test
```

#### End-To-End Tests
End-To-End tests (file extension `⋆.e2e.ts`) are performed by interacting with the (web-)application itself.
This includes tests which are consuming the engine API as well as tests that run against the UI.
The environment for these tests is a running instance of the NW.js production build, controlled by the tests through `puppeteer`.
To start these tests, simply run
```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Website Tests
Website tests (file extension `⋆.e2e.ts` in _/src/engine/websites_) will run some basic checks for each website.
The environment for these tests is a running instance of the NW.js production build, controlled by the tests through `puppeteer`.
[WARNING]
Running all tests will take very very long and may use up a lot of your internet bandwidth.

To start these test(s), simply run
```sh
# Test all websites
npm run test:websites
# Test a certain website
npm run test:websites -- MangaDex
```
