## Preview/Download Media

Before downloading data, it is up to the user to determine which website shall be used to get the desired title.
For this example the title [Berserk](https://mangadex.org/title/801513ba-a712-498c-8f57-cae55b38cc92/berserk) from the MangaDex website will be used.

## Apply URL from Browser

In some situations it may be useful to copy a link of a supported website title from the browser and paste it directly into HakuNeko (e.g., when updating the title list takes very long).
For this example the title [Berserk](https://mangadex.org/title/801513ba-a712-498c-8f57-cae55b38cc92/berserk) from the MangaDex website will be used.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Only links to titles of supported websites can be applied (see the list of supported websites).
Only links to titles are valid, links to chapters or episodes cannot be applied.

### Bypass CloudFlare

Various websites are protected by CloudFlare's Anti-Bot detection.
Unfortunately HakuNeko is detected as malicious browser and therefore has trouble to bypass the protection.
This workaround can be used to temporary access a website that is protected by CloudFlare.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Depending on the website the CloudFlare session may expire within 30 minutes ~ 30 days.
Therefore this workaround needs to be repeated in case the content of the website can no longer be accessed with HakuNeko.
